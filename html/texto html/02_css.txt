CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
1. Inline: by using the style attribute, to a single element
2. Internal: by using the style element (<style>) in the head section (<head>), for a single page.
3. External: by using the link element to link a css file (<link>), for a single document.







HTML colors are specified with predefined color names, or with RGB, HEX, HSL,
RGBA, or HSLA values.
