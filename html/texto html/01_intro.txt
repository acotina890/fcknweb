HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

The purpose of a web browser is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.
for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).

HTML elements can be nested (elements can contain other elements).
All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
Html is not case sensitive (<p> = <P>) but W3C recommends lowercase, not only for HTML,
also for stricter document types like XHTML.

Never skip the end tag.

HTML elements with no content and without a closing tag are called empty elements.






ATTRIBUTES ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements, are always specified
in the start tag and come in name/value pairs like: name="value".
<a href="archivo.html">
<img width="number" height="number"> (specified in pixels)
<p style="property css"> (it can be applied to any element)
<html lang="language-country"> (meant to assist search engines and browsers)
<span title=""> (almost applied to any element will be displayed as a tooltip when
you mouse over it)
Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also
be used. In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes,
it is necessary to use single quotes.


Always quote attributes values.





HEADINGS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are titles or subtitles.
Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.
Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.
Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document
structure.
Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use to make them big or bold.
Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any of the them with
the style attribute.






PARAGRAPHS --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.
browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

HORIZONTAL RULES
defines a thematic break in a page and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
is used to separate content (or define a change).

(for the poem problem, use <pre> instead of <p>)





TEXT FORMATTING ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text.





COMMENTS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- -->
HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML
source code.
You can place reminders and can be use to hide content (temporarily).
Are also great for debugging, because you can uncomment lines of code, one at a time,
to search for errors.




LINKS ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can click on a link and jump to another document. A link does not have to be text, it can be an img
also.
can be used to create bookmarks, so that readers can jump to specific parts of a web page.
With maps, you can create clickable areas on an image and be able to perform different actions.






IMAGES -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.
They are not technically inserted into a page, they are linked.





LISTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
allow web developers to group a set of related items.





BLOCK INLINE -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every element has a default display value (block and inline).
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space
(a margin) before and after the element. always takes up the full width available (stretches out
to the left and right as far as it can).





RESPONSIVE -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is about creating web pages (using HTML and CSS) that look good on all devices,
will automatically adjust for different.
• Setting the viewport (meta)
• Max-Width property (100% +height = auto)
• Show different images (picture)
• Text size (vw unit)









There are two ways to specify an URL:
1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website.
2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website.
(src="img.png" > it will be relative to the current page)
(src="/images/img.png" > it will be relative to the domain)
It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.
