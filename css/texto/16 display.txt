This property is the most important for controlling layout.

Every HTML element has a default display value. The <script> uses none (commonly used with
JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating)

Override the default value
Changing an inline element to a block element, or vice versa, can be useful for making the
page look a specific way. (li {display:inline}, an inline element with display:block
is not allowed to have other block elements inside it.)

display:none or visibility:hidden?
Hiding an element can be done by display:none and the page will be displayed as if the element
is not there. With visibility:hidden happens the same but the element will still take up the
same space as before, still affect the layout.


display: block, inline, inline-block





display:inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.
the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected (not display:inline)
does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.
