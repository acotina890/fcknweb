Do not include padding, borders, or margins. It sets the height/width of the area inside
the padding, border, and margin of the element.
The properties set the content area.

height / width: auto, px, pt, cm, em,..., %, initial, inherit



The max set the maximum width / height of an element.
When the element is smaller than the width, the browser adds a horizontal scrollbar.
Using this property will improve the browser's handling of small windows.
(if you declare "same" property with max and the value is larger, width > max-width,
the max property will be used and the other ignored)

max-width / height: px, pt, cm, em,..., %, none (default)


same happens with min.





Using width, max-width and margin:auto
Setting the width of a block element will prevent from stretching out to the edges of its container.
Then, you can set the margins to auto, to horizontally center the element within its container.
The element will take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally
between the two margins.
Using max-width instead will improve the browser's handling of small windows.
