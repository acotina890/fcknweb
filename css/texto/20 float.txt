used for positioning and formatting content, like an image float left to the text.
(wrap text around images)
However, we can let elements float next to each other too.
When we use it and we want the next element below, we use clear property.
When clearing floats, you should match the clear.

If a floated element is taller than the containing element, we can then add a clearfix hack.
(overflow:auto) works well as long as you are able to keep control of your margins and padding.

You can easily create three floating boxes side by side. However, when you add something
that enlarges the width of each box the box will break. So box-sizing allows us to include
the padding and border making sure that stays inside of the box and that it does not break.
(* {box-sizing: border-box})
However, it is not easy to create floating boxes with equal heights. Set a fixed height
is not very flexible, so this is where CSS3 Flexbox comes in handy: it can automatically stretch
boxes to be as long as the longest box.


You can use it with hyperlinks to creat a horizontal menu.
Is common to do an entire web layouts with float.


float: left, right, none, inherit
clear: left, right, none, inherit, both
