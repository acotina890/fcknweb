Are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

margin-top / right / bottom / left: px, pt, cm, em,..., %, inherit (NEGATIVE VALUES are allowed)
    auto (to horizontally center the element within its container)
    
    The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally
    between the left and right margins.

margin: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 values



Sometimes two margins collapse into a single margin.
In this example the h1 element has a bottom margin of 50px and the h2 element has a top margin
of 20px. So, the vertical margin between h1 and h2 should have been 70px (50px + 20px). However,
the actual margin ends up being 50px.
