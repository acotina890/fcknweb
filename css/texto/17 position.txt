position:
    static (default, not positioned in any special way, according to the normal flow of the page)
    relative (to its normal position. Setting top, right, bottom and left properties will cause
        to be adjusted away. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element)
    fixed (is positioned relative to the viewport, always stays in the same place even if the page
        is scrolled. You can use top, right, bottom and left properties)
    absolute (removed from the normal flow and can overlap elements. Is positioned relative
        to the nearest positioned ancestor, if hasn't, uses the document body, and moves along
        with page scrolling. You can use top, right, bottom and left properties)
    sticky (is positioned based on the user's scroll position, toggles between relative and fixed.
        You can use top property)

Then the elements are positioned using:
top: auto
bottom: auto
left: auto
right: auto
(these will not work if the position (they also work depending on the value) is not set)
